This is my solution for homework 3.

# Problem 1

## Get data

``` r
data("instacart")
```

## Explore data

The dimension of this data is 1384617, 15. It has 1384617 rows and 15
columns. It contains variables add\_to\_cart\_order, aisle, aisle\_id,
days\_since\_prior\_order, department, department\_id, eval\_set,
order\_dow, order\_hour\_of\_day, order\_id, order\_number, product\_id,
product\_name, reordered, user\_id.

It has variable for user `user_id`. Variables for orders are `order_id`,
`order_dow`, and `order_hour_of_day`. Variables for products are
`product_id` and `product_name`. There are also variables about aisle
and department, `aisle`, `aisle_id`, `department`, and `department_id`.

## Explore aisle

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # â€¦ with 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles. Among them, the aisle of fresh vegetables is the
most items ordered from.

## Make plot

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle,n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Make table: popular item

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(
    aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")
  ) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(
    rank = min_rank(desc(n))
  ) %>% 
  filter(rank <= 3) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

## Makle table: mean hour

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(
      product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")
    ) %>% 
    group_by(
      product_name, order_dow
    ) %>% 
    summarize(
      mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)
    ) %>% 
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
    ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

| product\_name    |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |
| :--------------- | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: |
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 | 15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 | 14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |

# Problem 2

## Get data

``` r
accel_df = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    starts_with("activity"),
    names_to = "min_activity",
    values_to = "count_activity",
    names_prefix = "activity_"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    day = as.factor(day), 
    day_id = as.integer(day_id), 
    week = as.integer(week), 
    min_activity = as.double(min_activity)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekend_vs_weekday = recode(
      day, 
      Monday = "weekday", 
      Tuesday = "weekday", 
      Wednesday = "weekday", 
      Thursday = "weekday", 
      Friday = "weekday", 
      Saturday = "weekend", 
      Sunday = "weekend" 
    )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    day = factor(
      day, levels = c(
        "Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"
      )
    )
  ) %>% 
  relocate("day_id", "week", "day", "weekend_vs_weekday") %>% 
  arrange(week, day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

After steps of tidying, the clean data has a dimension of 50400, 6.
`day_id` represents the order of day for the study. `week`, `day`, and
`weekend_vs_weekday` provide information about the day of study.
`min_activity` and `count_activity` shows the count of activities at
each minute of the day, recorded by the accelerometers.

## Make table: total activities

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarise(sum_activity = sum(count_activity)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = sum_activity, color = week)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(week ~ .)
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

<img src="p8105_hw3_sz2872_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />

As shown in the graph, there is not a obvious trend between day and
total activities.
